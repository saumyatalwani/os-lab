## Simulated Algorithms  

1. **C-LOOK Disk Scheduling**  
   - Efficient disk scheduling algorithm that reduces seek time by servicing requests in one direction before reversing.  
   - Simulates head movement across tracks and calculates total seek distance.  

2. **Dining Philosopher's Problem**  
   - Classic synchronization problem to avoid deadlock and starvation in concurrent processes.  
   - Implements mutexes and semaphores to manage philosopher states (Thinking, Hungry, Eating).  

3. **FIFO Page Replacement**  
   - Memory management algorithm that replaces the oldest page in memory when a page fault occurs.  
   - Simulates page hits and faults with customizable memory size.  

4. **Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling**  
   - Process scheduling algorithm that selects the process with the shortest burst time for execution.  

5. **Priority Scheduling Algorithm**  
   - Process scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a priority.  
   - The process with the highest priority is executed first, ensuring critical tasks are completed sooner.
